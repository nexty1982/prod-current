          # The "Canonical Truth" Instruction Set
          instructions: >
            1. Fix CORS: Ensure development origins are configured via environment or config (not hard-coded IPs) and added to the server's CORS middleware.
               Ensure it handles unauthorized origins gracefully (callback(null, false)) to prevent 500 errors.
            2. Canonical Health: Consolidate 'server/src/routes/systemRoutes.js'.
               It must return the Node version reported by process.version (Node 20.x expected) and use 'SELECT 1' to verify MariaDB for the 3rd status dot.
            3. Header Sync: Ensure only 'front-end/src/layouts/full/vertical/header/Header.tsx' is updated with the 3-dot polling logic.
            4. Cleanup: Identify and flag duplicate 'Header.tsx' files in 'refactor-src' for deletion.
