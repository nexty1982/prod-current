        question: 'What image formats and quality are needed?',
        answer: 'Supported formats include JPG, PNG, and PDF. For best results, use high-resolution scans (300+ DPI) with even lighting and minimal page skew. The system handles both typed and handwritten text in English and Greek, though handwritten entries may need manual correction.',
      },

        question: 'How does column mapping work?',

      {
        question: 'How do I approve and import OCR results?',
