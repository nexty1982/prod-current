Task: Rewrite front-end/src/views/records/SSPPOCRecordsPage.tsx to render records dynamically based on whatever columns the API returns, no hard-coded column definitions.

Goals

Use the selected record type (e.g., baptism/marriage/funeral) to determine the DB table name and request rows.

Build the columns at runtime from the keys of the first row.

Pretty headers: snake_case → “Title Case”.

Smart formatting: any key that matches /_date$/ or /(^|_)date($|_)/ gets date formatting.

Exclusions: hide obvious system/audit keys by default (id is still used for getRowId).

Sorting: client-side sort by any column.

No references to legacy getColumnDefinitions or camelCase accessors.

Keep the existing page chrome (title, selectors) but replace the table logic entirely.

Assumptions

API endpoint returns either:

data: Row[] (preferred), or

raw array Row[]
If needed, adjust to GET /api/records?table=<name>&limit=… or GET /api/records/<name> depending on what’s already implemented. Don’t change the server unless absolutely required; prefer inferring columns from the first row.

Implementation Steps

Backup the file, then fully replace it.

Use React + TypeScript, no additional libs beyond what’s already in the project.

Build columns from Object.keys(firstRow) after fetch.

Provide excludeList and headerMap to override specific labels.

Provide formatCell to handle dates and nulls.

Provide resilient getRowId that uses id, otherwise falls back to a stable hash of values.

Remove all getColumnDefinitions calls and any camelCase fallbacks.
